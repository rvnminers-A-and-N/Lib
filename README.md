# SatoriLib

Supports the various repos of the Satori Network.

Contains Domain Model and APIs.

## P2P Networking

SatoriLib now includes `satorip2p` as an optional dependency for P2P networking support. When installed and configured, Neuron and Engine will use P2P communication instead of central servers.

See the [satorip2p repository](https://github.com/SatoriNetwork/satorip2p) for documentation.
